NY Public School Test Result Scores Analysis

This project aims to explore and analyze SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) scores data from educational institutions. The dataset used in this project contains information on schools, their average scores across reading, writing, and math sections, and other relevant details.

Objective:
The primary objective is to conduct an in-depth analysis of SAT scores across schools, identifying top-performing institutions and understanding the performance trends. The analysis involves computing total scores, identifying schools with exceptional performance, and exploring variations among different educational institutions.

Key Features:

Data Exploration: The project begins with data exploration, performing data cleaning, and inspecting essential characteristics of the dataset.
Total Score Computation: Total SAT scores are computed by summing individual scores from reading, writing, and math sections for each school.
Identifying Top Schools: Top-performing schools are identified based on total SAT scores, presenting the top 10 schools with their respective scores.
Statistical Analysis: Statistical techniques are applied to gain insights into performance variations, identifying trends, and analyzing patterns across different schools and regions.
Visualization: Visual representations, such as plots and graphs, are used to present findings, trends, and comparisons effectively.
Tools Used:
The project utilizes Python programming language and various data analysis libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data handling, manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

This SAT Scores Analysis Project provides an insightful exploration into educational institution performance based on SAT scores, aiming to derive meaningful conclusions and insights for stakeholders in the education sector.
